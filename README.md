This project was created by  a project group within [DSS @ Berkeley](https://dssberkeley.com/), a student-run data science focused organization at UC Berkeley, in Fall '23.

Our project focused on forecasting the comprehensive costs—encompassing economic, health-related, and mental burdens—of gender-based violence on employees. Our aim was to raise awareness among U.S. businesses. We utilized a formula that dissects gender and economic costs up to FY 2022. To visualize and communicate our findings effectively, we utilized Streamlit and Plotly Dash in crafting an interactive dashboard.

The formula communicated is as follows:

Lifetime Cost of IPV and Rape to firm= (2022 Victim Cost per Rape for men x (1 in 26 men .038x number of men at firm)) + (2022 Victim Cost of Rape per Woman Victim (One in 4 women or .268 x number of women at firm)+ (2022 Victim Cost of IPV per Male Victim (40 percent (44.2% or 52.1 million) x number of men at the firm)) +(2022 Victim Cost of IPV per Female Victim ( (1 in 2 women .473 x number of women at the firm))

Our final app can be found in the file FWV_app.py, which can be launched through the terminal by running `run streamlit [file path]`. This will open up a multi-page Streamlit dashboard wiht the first page characterizing the costs of gender-based violence in a table and with multiple visualizations, and the second page depicting prevalence of violence for different demographic groups. In the long term, we hope this will be implemented on a policy scale with updated data.
